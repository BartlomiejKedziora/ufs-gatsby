        <p>
          Personal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU

          such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious
          information such as identification numbers, electronic location data,
          and other online identifiers.

          We will only store or transfer your personal data within the European
          Economic Area (the “EEA”). The EEA consists of all EU member states,
          plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. This means that your personal
          data will be fully protected under the GDPR or to equivalent standards

          9. Do You Share My Personal Data?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We may sometimes contract with the following third parties to supply
          certain products AND/OR services. These may include payment
          processing, delivery, and marketing. In some cases, those third
          parties may require access to some or all of your personal data that
          hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any of your personal data is required by a third party, as
          described above, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data
          is handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, our
          obligations, and the third party’s obligations under the law, as

          In order to effectively process credit card transactions, it may be

          (EEA). Such information will not be transferred out of the EEA for any
          other purpose.
        </p>

          If any personal data is transferred outside of the EEA, we will take
          suitable steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated
          just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the
          GDPR, as explained above in Part 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share
          certain personal data, which might include yours, if we are involved
          in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court
          order, or the instructions of a government authority.

          personal data at all. However, to use all features and functions
          available on Our Site you may be required to submit or allow for the

          11. How Can I Access My Personal Data?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can ask
          us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any
          such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access
          request”.
        </p>

          All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the
          email or postal addresses shown in Part 12.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your
          request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you
          make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our
          administrative costs in responding.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will respond to your subject access request within 14days and, in
          any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to
          provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data
          within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request
          is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three
          months from the date we receive your request. You will be kept fully
          informed of our progress.
